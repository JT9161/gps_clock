A GPS discipined clock built using an Arduino Uno board. Currently in beta. 

TODO: Refine NMEA setence handeling, integrate UV bulb.

Initial features: 
  * Display time in ISO8601 format
  * Automatically determine and adjust for timezone. 

Future plans:
  * Allow easy custimization of display
  * Adjust hardware design to allow clock to be run from solar panel (hopefully). 
  * Integrate with UV bulb to emulate sunlight.
